Nazar Project GIT

This is an extension of the Eyecan project and it is a rough protoype.  Do not expect any great commenting 
or style in this code currenty it is currently pre- alpha.

The goals of this prototype are to :

1. implement multithreaded capture and Computer Vision processing paths
2. develop a modular framework to plug and play different Computer Vision techniques
3. use ANN as a post process module for controlling outputs.
4. Develp on multiple platforms
  - MAC (initial launch)
  - Windows
  - Android
  - Linux
  - Raspberry PI (Linux + hardware)
5. implement alternative inputs such as sound and EEG
